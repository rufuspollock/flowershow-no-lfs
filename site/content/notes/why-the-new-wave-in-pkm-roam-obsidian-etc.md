# Why is there this new wave of PKM tools like Roam, Obsidian etc

Started with this comment of mine ~ late 2020

New-fangled graph-oriented knowledge systems seem all the rage e.g. Roam and now a plethora of others Foam, Dendron, Obsidian, Athens Research etc etc (though seem incredibly similar to wikis ... but with backlinks and block level linking ...)

cf also the connection with the [[notes/zettelkasten|zettelkasten]] methodology.
