You may have many different types of notes that you want to display in different ways on your Flowershow website, like tutorials, docs, news, or... recipes! In this tutorial, we will cover how to add a custom `RecipeLayout` for our recipe blog posts.

## Recipe page metadata

Since we are making a `Recipe` type, we may want to display the following information about our recipes:

- difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- time (how much time it takes)
- serves (number of people served)
- ingredients (list of all ingredients needed)
- created (date when post was written)
- authors (authors of post)
- layout (our new custom layout's name)

Obviously, we could just write all this data inline, e.g. in a bullet list above or below the recipe instructions, but this way we will be able to access this data in a custom layout created specifically for our recipes and display it in a consistent way across all the recipes and in a nicer way (e.g. show ingredients list in a sidebar, or display prep time and servings with nice styling and icons).

So, let's create our first recipe! We'll add the following content to `<your-content-folder>/recipes/lasagne.md`.

```md

## Create a custom page layout

After creating our first recipe, we are ready to create a custom layout to display the recipe instructions along with the creation date, title, authors, difficulty, servings, prep time, ingredients.

Let's create a file named `RecipeLayout.tsx` in `.flowershow/layouts` folder with the following content:

```jsx
export default function RecipeLayout({ children, ...frontMatter }) {
  const {
    created,
    title,
    authors,
    difficulty,
    serves,
    time,
    ingredients,
    image,
  } = frontMatter;
  return (
    <article className="docs prose prose-a:text-primary dark:prose-a:text-primary-dark prose-strong:text-primary dark:prose-strong:text-primary-dark prose-code:text-primary dark:prose-code:text-primary-dark prose-headings:text-primary dark:prose-headings:text-primary-dark text-primary dark:text-primary-dark prose-headings:font-headings dark:prose-invert prose-a:break-words mx-auto p-6">

        </div>
      </header>
      <section>{children}</section>
    </article>
  );
}
```

The last thing we need to do is to export the layout from `.flowershow/layouts/index.ts` file, so that it can then be imported by Flowershow to render our recipe documents.

> [!note]
> Note, that the name under which the layout is exported needs to match the name of the layout specified in the frontmatter, in this case `recipe`.

```javascript {2,6}
...
import RecipeLayout from "./RecipeLayout";

export default {
  ...
  recipe: RecipeLayout
};
```

After applying some Tailwind classes, an example recipe blog post will look like this:

![[recipePost.png]]

An additional benefit of this approach, is that if in the future we would like to change the way our recipes look, we can do this just by adjusting our recipe layout, instead of doing this for every single recipe post.

The last step we have is to create a home page where all our recipes will be displayed.

For more information on creating custom layouts, you can read the documentation [here](https://flowershow.app/docs/layouts).
