## What is Flowershow?
Flowershow is an open-source tool for easily converting your markdown files into an elegant website. It's built on standard, modern web stack ‚Äì **React**, **Next.js** and **Tailwind** and shipped with a basic **default theme** (used to publish this website) to get you started with just a few clicks. 

Flowershow supports **CommonMark** and **GitHub Flavored Markdown**, but also many **Obsidian-specific syntax elements**, like internal links or footnotes[^1].
[^1]: Support for some GFM and Obsidian-specific syntax elements is still work in progress. See our [[docs/index]] to learn more.

## Quick Start

<div className="border-2 border-slate-400 rounded-md px-4 pb-3 mb-3">
‚ùï **Pre-requisites**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
</div>

Currently there is only one starter template - default template[^2]. The fastest way to use it to bootstrap your website is:
[^2]: We plan to develop a few different starter templates, so that you can pick the one that suits your needs and style most. See our [[docs/index]] to learn more.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/flowershow/flowershow/tree/main/templates/default
# or
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/flowershow/flowershow/tree/main/templates/default
```

‚ùï At the moment, we are in the process of testing Flowershow's core features by using it to create this website's code and content. Thus, for now, Flowershow's github repository is basically a repository of this website. If you go to [the repo](https://github.com/flowershow/flowershow), you'll notice it has the following structure:

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ default
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content -> ../../site/content # symlink to site/content
|      ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ site # this website's content and configuration
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ content # folder with our md notes and userConfig.js
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ userConfig.js
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs
|       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ demo
‚îÇ¬†¬†    ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
```

`/site` is where all Flowershow website's data resides. All page's content that you can read on this website lies inside of the `/content` subdirectory. To write this content, most of the time we use Obsidian, so if you also use Obsidian, you can imagine `/content` being your Obsidian vault.

Important thing to notice here, is that apart from folders with our markdown notes (eg. `/demo`) there are also two additional files: `userConfig.js` and `index.md`.

- `userConfig.js` is where all the user configuration should be written. 
- `index.md`, which serves as a front page for our website.

At the moment both of these files are required by Flowershow and should be placed at the root of your notes folder (i.e. inside your Obsidian vault) [^3].
[^3]: In the future these files will be added automatically by the CLI tool.

Now, after you've created a next app using Flowershow template, there are two things that will prevent you from running it: an incorrect `content` symlink and missing `userConfig.js` file. Let's fix this!

**Updating symlink to content folder**

If you go to the folder where you've next-created your Flowershow app, you'll notice there is a symlink named `content`, which will point to a non-existing directory `../../site/content` , a folder we're using to store this website's markdown. You simply need to update it to point to the directory with your markdown notes (e.g. your Obsidian vault). You can do it with the following commands:

```bash
# go to the folder where you've next-created your app
cd my-flowershow-app-folder
# update the incorrect symlink
ln -sfn ~/Path/to/your/md/notes content
```

To check where the `content` link points now:

```bash
readlink -f content
```

**Adding `userConfig.js` file**

Now, let's add an empty `userConfig.js` file to the directory with your notes:

```bash
cd ~/Path/to/your/md/notes
touch userConfig.js
```

At this point, you should be able to run the app. You can check, that it compiles, by running:

```bash
npm run dev
# or 
npm run build
npm start
```

However, when you [open the app in your browser](http://localhost:3000/), you'll notice the website is welcoming you with 404 page. This is because you don't have an `index.md` file in the root of your content directory. (All other markdown files will already be available under their corresponding paths.) You can easily fix this by adding a basic `index.md` page to the root of your content folder.

```bash
cd ~/Path/to/your/md/notes
touch index.md
echo "# Welcome to my Flower Show\!" > index.md
```

Hurray üéä! You've just created a website out of your markdown notes with a little help from Flowershow üå∑!

## Deploying

This part is up to you. Our app is Next.js based, so youe can use any of these hosting providers: Vercel, Cloudflare, Netlify and others to deploy the site.
