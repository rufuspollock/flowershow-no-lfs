title: Site-wide table of contents (LHS Sidebar)
---

Flowershow supports adding a site-wide table of contents in a LFH sidebar to allow your users to easily navigate to other pages on your website.

## Enabling / disabling the sidebar

The sidebar is disabled by default. You can enable it for all your pages in your `config.js` file, and then disable it for some of your pages, like e.g. your home page.

### For all pages

To show the sidebar on all the pages, simply set `showSidebar` variable to `true` in your config file as shown below:

```js
// config.js

const config = {
  showSidebar: true,
};
```

### For a single page

You can also enable/disable the sidebar for specific pages by setting `showSidebar` to `true` or `false` in the page's frontmatter like below.

```md
---
showToc: false
---
```

## ðŸš§ Configuring sidebar contents

Currently all the pages on your website (apart from pages marked as drafts) will be listed in the Sidebar. In the next iteration we'll enable configuring it as well as grouping of your pages.
