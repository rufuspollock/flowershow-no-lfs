# Markdown syntax support

Flowershow was designed with Obsidian users in mind, and so, it aims to fully support Obsidian syntax, including **CommonMark**, **GitHub Flavoured Markdown** and **Obsidian extensions**, like Wiki links.

## CommonMark

Here are some of the CommonMark syntax elements supported by Flowershow.

### Thematic breaks

Thematic breaks made with three `*`, `-` or `_` will be converted to HTML `<hr />`

**Example:**

```md
---
---

---
```

**Renders as:**

---

---

---

### Headings

Markdown headings will be converted to HTML `<h1>`-`<h6>` tags.

**Example:**

```md
# Heading 1

...

###### Heading 6
```

**Renders as:**
All the headings on this page 🙂.

### Emphasis

**I'm Bold!** is done using `**I'm Bold!**`  
**I'm Bold!** is done using `__I'm Bold!__`

*I'm Italic!* is done using `*I'm Italic!*`  
*I'm Italic!* is done using `_I'm Italic!_`

### Fenced code blocks with code highlighting

Code blocks created with backtics will be parsed as `pre` tags with support for code highlighting in respective languages and copy/paste button included on hover.

**Javascript example:**

```javascript
const ExampleCode = () => {
  return <div> .... </div>;
};
```

**Python example:**

```python
class Example:
	def code(self,test):
		return 'Code highlighter'
```

**Bash example:**

```bash
git commit && git push
```

### Blockquotes

**Example:**

```md
> Roses are red, violets are blue.
```

**Renders as:**

> Roses are red, violets are blue.

### Lists

**Example:**

```md
- one
- two

1. one
2. two
   - one
   - two
```

**Renders as:**

- one
- two

1. one
2. two
   - one
   - two

### Inline code

**Example:**

```md
Here is some code: `print("hello world!")`
```

**Renders as:**

Here is some code: `print("hello world!")`

### Links

**Example:**

```md
[Link to roadmap](/docs/roadmap)
```

**Renders as:**

[Link to roadmap](/docs/roadmap)

### Images

**Example:**

```md
![tulip](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/2/abstract-flowers-rose-sciberras.jpg)
```

**Renders as:**

![tulip](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/2/abstract-flowers-rose-sciberras.jpg)

### 🚧 Indented code blocks

**Example:**

```md
    a simple
    	indented code block
```

**Renders as:**  
 a simple
indented code block

## GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extensions

### Tables

**Example:**

```md
| Left | Center | Right |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| 1    |   2    |     3 |
```

**Renders as:**

| Left | Center | Right |
| :--- | :----: | ----: |
| 1    |   2    |     3 |

### Task lists

**Example:**

```md
- [x] one thing to do
- [ ] a second thing to do
  - [ ] another thing to do!
```

**Renders as:**

- [x] one thing to do
- [ ] a second thing to do
  - [ ] another thing to do!

### Strikethrough

~~I'm CrossedOut!~~ is done using `~~I'm CrossedOut!~~`

### Autolinks

**Example:**

```md
Check out Flowershow at https://flowershow.app!
```

## Other extensions

### Obisidian internal links (Wiki links)

Wiki links are hyperlinks that give one-click access to other pages on the site. These are usually denoted with double square brackets `[[some_page]]` and Obsidian would generate the reference to that page automatically.

Flowershow will convert internal links to HTML `a` tags, with their `href` attributes pointing to the location referenced by original internal links.

**Internal link types**

- Link to a page, e.g. `[[roadmap]]`, which renders as [[roadmap]]
- Link to a page with a custom name, e.g. `[[roadmap|Our roadmap]]`, which renders as [[roadmap|Our roadmap]]
- Link to a specific heading within a given page `[[roadmap#Planned features]]`, which renders as [[roadmap#Planned features]]
- Link to a specific heading within a given page with a custom name, e.g. `[[roadmap#Planned features|🚧 working on...]]` which renders as [[roadmap#Planned features|🚧 working on...]]
- 🚧 Link to a specific block (paragraph) within a given page, e.g. `[[roadmap#^f93ba0]]`
- Link to an image file with supported image formats - png, jpg and jpeg, eg. `![[park.png]]` which renders as:
  ![[park.png]]

### Footnotes

**Example:**

```md
Roses are red... [^1]

[^1]: ...violets are blue.
```

Roses are red... [^1]

[^1]: ...violets are blue.

### Math

**Example:**

```md
$$\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\ c & d \end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$
```

**Renders as:**

$$\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\ c & d \end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$

### Frontmatter

You can add metadata to your pages, by adding key-value pairs to frontmatter, e.g.:

```md
---
title: Flower Show
description: A tool for publishing markdown notes.
mymeta: Some info
---
```

The `title` and `description` fields are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.

### Dashes/Ellipse

Two '-' will convert to ndash. Three '-' will convert to mdash. Three '.' with or without spacing will convert to ellipse.

**Example:**

```md
--ndash
---mdash
...ellipse
. . .another ellipse
```

**Renders as:**\
–ndash\
—mdash\
...ellipse\
...another ellipse

### PDF embedding

**Example:**

```md
![[sample.pdf]]
```

**Renders as:**  
![[sample.pdf]]

### 🚧 Text highlighting

==I'm Highlighted!== is done using `==I'm Highlighted!==`

### 🚧 Excalidraw sketches support

Displaying embedded [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) sketches.

**Example:**

```md
![[customizability-vs-upgradeability-efficient-frontier-2022-06-26]]
```

**Renders as:**  
![[customizability-vs-upgradeability-efficient-frontier-2022-06-26]]

### 🚧 Comments

**Example:**

```md
Here is some inline comments: %%You can't see this text%%

Here is a block comment:
%%
It can span
multiple lines
%%
```

**Renders as:**

Here is some inline comments: %%You can't see this text%%

Here is a block comment:
%%
It can span
multiple lines
%%
