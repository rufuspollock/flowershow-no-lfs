title: Table of contents
---

You can add a table of contents to your markdown pages by including a heading with `Table of contents` string in it (case insensitive).

The table of contents will only include headings placed below the `Table of contents` heading.

**Example:**

```md
# Some blog page
## Table of contents
## Some heading
## Another heading
### Yet another heading
```

**Renders as:**

# Some blog page
## Table of contents
## Some heading
## Another heading
### Yet another heading
