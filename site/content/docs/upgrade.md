title: Upgrading Flowershow and a Flowershow Site
---

For a simple site you can just upgrade Flowershow and republish.

For a "custom" site i.e. where you are using Flowershow as a NextJS template you will need to do more.

## Upgrading a NextJS site built with Flowershow

See `packages/flowershow/upgrade.sh` in the Flowershow github repo.

You will probably have to do some custom merging.
