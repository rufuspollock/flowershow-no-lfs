## Plan

Simplest approach right now is ...

* [ ] Getting a front page
  * [ ] Allow for (at least) 2 different layouts: a) "content/documentation" (classic markdown style) b) "landing" (or just "unstyled") which is pretty much a raw page with navbar and footer ie. unstyled
  * [ ] Switch landing page to unstyled
  * [ ] Create it either directly or using components
* [x] Getting the site building

# Reflections

Thinking about he spectrum of customizability and its relationship to upgradeability. And further, the relationship of that to the distinct of frameworks vs products.

## Spectrum of customizability

The more you want to be able to customize the more you want to use a framework and basically scaffold an app and then customize that app.

```
  o--------------------------------------------o
very little                                  lots of
customizability                           customizability
```

Let's take one example related to our situation: configuring theme colors.

We are using tailwind. Thus, it makes sense to use tailwind existing config system e.g. https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors and especially https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#naming-your-colors (ie. using named colors like `primary` in the design and then allowing user to change the value for primary).

However, if we let the user edit tailwind.config.js then what happens if the core app (Flowershow) wants to edit tailwind.config.js, for example to support a new version of tailwind? Now there is potentially a conflict that requires manual intervention.

The alternative is to define a specific subset of tailwind config that users can edit and expose that explicitly and separately in the Flowershow config. In its essence this is creating a clear interface between user domain and the app domain. It has obvious benefits in separating concerns. However, its cost is twofold. First, the app must now mirror any user-relevant changes down into the user config. Second, there is a limitation on what the user can do - only those things explicitly exposed are now available.

What this is imply is there is a **trade-off between customize-ability (power) and upgrade-ability**. Total customize-ability is editing of anything! But that also means that almost nothing is automatically upgradeable.

Whilst there may be a trade-off what is the efficient frontier here and are there ways to move that efficient frontier?

For example. Suppose we create the scaffolded app via a git clone of a template then it may be easier to track what user changes have been made -- crudely git pull will fail when there are conflicts and the user will have some visibility into what they have to resolve manually.

NB: a problem for the git approach is in initial app creation: i am limited to one or a few specific templates. A code or cli based approach may allow much more variety via composition of different features into a working app.

Emerging dimensions

- Customizability: how much can i customize my app (once created)
  - Create-ability: how much can i customize the creation of the app. Note this is really a subset of customizability and is identical in many situations e.g. a wordpress install. However, for many static site generators these are quite distinct and most of the customization opportunity is at this stage.
- Upgradeability: how easy is it to upgrade my app to use a new version of the framework/product
- Complexity: how complex is it for developers to build the framework/product and/or for users to use or customize it?

The ultimate question is where is the sweet-spot (for us)?

One the hand you can just ship a customized nextjs template and let's users have at it.

The major issue with that is that once users start modifying, upgrading is manual and often painful.

On the other end of the spectrum you keep the nextjs app template (or whatever it is) very private, creating a very clean separation of content and config. This makes it relatively easy to upgrade but potentially greatly limits what a user can do.

IMO our sweet spot lies more towards the latter for a few reasons:

- There is already lot in the first category -- and its close to plain nextjs
- The lack of upgradeability is a major issue (and even if createability). cf e.g. [[notes/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog]]
  - This upgrade-ability is especially an issue if the core product or its underlying components are rapidly developing (as is often the case here i.e. nextjs, tailwind etc)
- There is a major set of users who want something they don't have to worry about maintaining (including me!). This is especially true if you want a product that can have a cloud option (and is ultimately financially sustainable ie. that users pay for)

The question is where exactly and how do we implement it.

## Frameworks vs Products

### Frameworks

Framework examples: rails, flask, nextjs etc etc.

What they consist of is:

- Some core libraries (which can be upgraded)
- app scaffolding (more painful to upgrade)
- patterns and documentation
- a community

### Products

Examples:

- webflow
- squarespace
- microsoft word

### Hybrids 

are things like wordpress or drupal. They are half-framework, half-product. The core is pretty standard and you don't edit but there is a ton of plugins and themeing going on and you don't scaffold an app at the start - you install and start editing content like webflow.
