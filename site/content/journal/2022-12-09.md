# [[design-cli|Self-publish]] experience teardown

- [ ] errors out if i specify a content folder that does not exist e.g. `content` (couldn't we create this for the user)
  - [ ] we know it will have errors later if you select folder you are in as content folder (i believe ...)
- [ ] asks me about assets folder but i don't know what this is ...
- [ ] very slow installing

  ```bash
  ðŸŒ·  Creating Flowershow template in /Users/rgrp/src/flowershow/flowershow/examples/wordpress-to-flowershow/.flowershow
  â ™  Installing Flowershow dependencies
  ```

  The installing takes a long time with no updates as to what is happening.

  ðŸ’¡ Could we pipe through info about the install to the user?

  Suspect even that something has crashed but no info to the user ... (e.g. 2m+). Actually it was ok. Just took ~5m.
