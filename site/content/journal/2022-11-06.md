- Worked on [[notes/obsidian-database-research]]
- https://thenewstack.io/obsidian-and-the-case-for-using-more-markdown/ - evidence for [[markdown take-off]] i.e. that markdown is getting very popular and outside of niche of developers. cf discussions in [[about]] page on this.
- Seems like stuff has been going a bit slowly at Roam e.g.

    > Everything in Roam seems to have been completely abandoned. I guess the developers already made their big money with all the believers plans and run with it on a permanent holiday. Roam development hasn’t been active for almost the last two years and it doesn’t seem to be bouncing back either. So what do you want to see in the newsletter? Pictures of the founder on the swimming pool? News regarding all of the x Roam developers moving to the new and upcoming apps with active fast development? If nothing good is happening to Roam they don’t have material to write a newsletter either. What a shame for such a promising app to let it die in stagnation like this…

    > It may have to do with losing a number of developers that left for other projects, many months back, a little while after the Roam42 guy went to Obsidian. Then over the past few months I'm no longer seeing any official emails from Roam Research, announcements, newsletter, etc., that used to be fairley regular. Unofficial newsletters that have focused on Roam for a while, have been shifting to focusing on other similar applications with little mention of Roam, now. IMHO, it just seems like communication, development, and marketing have all slowed to a crawl.
