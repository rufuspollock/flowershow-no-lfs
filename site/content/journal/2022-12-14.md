Research on [[notes/databases]] related to creating our own [[notes/content-layer]]

Two options i can see atm:

- sqlite. can just use locally for build. if needed on site now getting sqlite in wasm
- indexeddb with dexie. some inclination towards this as [[notes/obsidian-database-research|Obsidian seems to use IndexedDB]]
