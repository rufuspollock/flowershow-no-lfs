# Flowershow

## Publish your obsidian vault simply and easily for free

Turn your markdown digital notes into an elegant, shareable website in seconds without coding. Easy to use, fully-featured, obsidian compatible and open-source.

- **Works with your existing content out of the box**: no need to modify wiki syntax `[[...]]` or change file layout to have it working.
- **Completely configurable**: easily set your analytics, keep content private, tweak colors and more. 
- **Stay in control of your content**: you own your content, we just publish it. Plus self-publishing is supported if you want to have full control of the entire process.
- **Customize and extend (if that’s your thing!)**: Flowershow is easy to extend and customize and is built on standard, modern open-source webstack – React, NextJS, Tailwind etc.
- **Support available**: as well as the free community discussions and chat, we can also provide professional support if you need it as well as custom development.

### Why the Name?

Flowershow is about sharing your digital garden -- putting it "on show" to the world. And what do you have in your garden? Flowers! Hence "Flowershow": it "shows off your digital garden to the world"!
