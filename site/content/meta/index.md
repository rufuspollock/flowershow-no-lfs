### Table of contents

Again tailwindcss.com is excellent. For example: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors

Two contents sections:

- LHS: full site table of contents
- RHS: table of contents for this page

### Obsidian markdown syntax

What's needed:

- [ ] `[[Internal link]]`
- [ ] `[[Internal link|With custom text]]`
- [ ] `[[Internal link#heading]]`
- [ ] `[[Internal link#heading|With custom text]]`

ðŸš© Not sure these are needed to start with

- [ ] `![[Embed note]]`
- [ ] `![[Embed note#heading]]`
