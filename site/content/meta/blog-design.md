# Job Stories

When creating a website I often want a section of news or blog posts so that people can read the latest updates

- Can have this as a dedicated section
- However, if focused on digital gardens may not want to have to distinguish blog posts from other notes. Why not just have these as "special" notes e.g. there is frontmatter field: `blog: true` or something
- Frontmatter: have to have a date
- Features:
  - chronicle listing in backwards order
  - Pagination?
