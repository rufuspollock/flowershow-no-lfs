Hey digital gardeners! 💐

Why did the banana go to the doctor? 👨‍⚕️ Because it wasn't peeling well! 🍌

Here are some of the new features we have implemented. 😎🚀

## Page comments

Flowershow supports the integration of [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/), or [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) to add comments functionality to your website, allowing visitors to provide their feedback and thoughts on your content.

## Site wide table of contents

Flowershow supports adding a site-wide table of contents in a LHS sidebar to allow your users to easily navigate to other pages on your website.
