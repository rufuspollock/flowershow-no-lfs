Hey digital gardeners! 💐

If you were **planting**🌱 to get some updates, you would be correct!

Here are some of the new features we have implemented. 😎🚀

### Blog Feature

Apart from the `Page` document type, which Flowershow uses for all your content files by default, you can also use the `Blog` type for your blog posts. This way you'll be able to fetch and display them on any of your pages by using our `BlogsList` component (or you can create a custom one).

### Wordpress to Flowershow Tool

If you are looking to convert your Wordpress site into a Flowershow site, we now have a tool that can help you with that!
