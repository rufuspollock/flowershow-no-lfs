Hey digital gardenersðŸŒ±!

Thank you so much for your interest in Flowershow!

Here are some of the new features we have implemented. ðŸ˜ŽðŸš€


### Right Hand Side (RHS) Table of Contents (ToC)

Flowershow supports adding a [RHS ToC sidebar](https://flowershow.app/docs/table-of-contents#right-hand-side-rhs)  to your pages.

As an alternative to Algolia search engine integration, Flowershow now supports local content search with [Kbar](https://flowershow.app/docs/search).

### Custom data getters

A new [data frontmatter field](https://flowershow.app/docs/mdx#use-data-field-type-for-custom-data-getters) allows you to create and access custom functions in your markdown, which you can use to fetch data from local JSON files, from external APIs or even from your content files themselves - and use them in your custom components!

### Windows support

You can now use our Flowershow CLI to build your sites on Windows.

### Video tutorial
