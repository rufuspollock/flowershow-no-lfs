## Why Flowershow

Publishing a digital garden isn't easy. As [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/philosophy/) puts it:

> There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.

In our case to easy and free we'd add _elegant_ and _customizable_.

More generally, publishing markdown isn't easy. And it should be, really easy, as easy as publishing a Facebook post, or posting a tweet.

The goal of Flowershow is to make it easy, fast and fun to publish your digital garden -- and do it beautifully.

## Backstory

We've been building content and data driven websites for over a decade.

We loved markdown and had been using it internally for a long time. Over last few years, we'd found we could even start using it with some of our non-technical clients.

As a result we have been building tooling and sites with markdown as the content layer. This formed the basis for Flowershow which started out as an internal tool focused on scaffolding generic markdown-driven websites around NextJS.

Enter Obsidian! A year and a half ago some of team started using obsidian personally. Many of us loved it and started using it for content authoring especially on wiki-like sites.

We then found we wanted to be able to publish resulting notes and vaults especially with some of features obsidian brings for granted -- ranging from all those markdown goodies like math, gfm etc but also the more exciting stuff like the network graph that really makes obsidian special. So we started working on adding these features to Flowershow.

Finally, we ️thought a wider community could benefit from what we were doing. So we decided to make the effort to tidy up what we'd been doing and open source it to allow others to benefit and contribute.

## The Bigger Picture

### We need better collective sensemaking

- Sensemaking is the ability to "make sense" of reality
- We are struggling in our sensemaking individually and collectively -- just think of the debates over climate change or covid vaccinations.
- Sensemaking is especially important right now because of the complexity of our societies and the challenges we face

### One part of better sensemaking is tooling for sensemaking

One part of better sensemaking is (technical) tools for sensemaking.[^1]

[^1]: Other parts include our inner capacities for sensemaking e.g. critical thinking, open-mindedness, curiosity, questioning etc. However, these are out of scope here!

- These range from tools for acquiring raw data, to tools for managing that data, to tools for analysing data and producing information, knowledge and insight
- One important area are tools for organizing our (unstructured) information and knowledge -- and sharing and collaborating on that with others
- Wikis and digital gardens are one major way of doing that

### The markdown revolution

The markdown revolution is bringing new energy and potential to "old" ideas such as wikis, zettelkastens etc.

- Markdown "plus" and its toolchain are becoming a powerful and flexible "digital notepaper" on which rich digital notebooks can be written
- History of computing shows the strength of simple, composable tools even if crude over sophisticated, complex ones especially over the long-term
- Markdown will still be there in 10 or 20 years
- Markdown is a great (best) basis for rich digital notes
- More importantly, combined with something like git (and a link database) it is now a great basis for a digital _notebook_ (aka wiki)

### Though much still missing for markdown to fulfil on its potential

There is still a lot to be done in the markdown ecosystem to fulfil on this potential

### Publishing is one important, initial area

Publishing is one important, initial area

- Intelligence is collective: we need to interact on and build on each others insights and ideas
- That involves sharing content within a group or publicly.
- It is best if that is part of an _open_ ecosystem (not e.g. facebook or even twitter)
- The simplest way to do that is some kind of publishing.
- Publishing markdown is still painful. It should be as easy as publishing a facebook post.
