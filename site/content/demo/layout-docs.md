title: I'm rendered using Docs layout to dipslay this content!
---

This is a demo page of the **Docs** layout.

Note we didn't need to specify `layout: docs` in the frontmatter (see [[layout-unstyled| Unstyled layout demo page]] for comparison). 

```md

title: I'm rendered using Docs layout to dipslay this content!
---
```

This is because **Docs** layout is the default layout of this template.

Source code can be found here -> `FLOWERSHOW_DIR/templates/default/layouts/docs.js`


> [!INFO] Future releases
> We plan to enable changing default layout by the user.
