The "Tao Te Ching", roughly translated into _The Book of the Way and of Virtue_, is a Chinese classic text written around 400 BC and traditionally credited to the sage _Laozi_. The text's authorship, date of composition and date of compilation are still debated.

It is a fundamental text for both philosophical and religious Taoism and strongly influenced other schools of Chinese philosophy and religion, including Legalism, Confucianism, and Chinese Buddhism, which was largely interpreted through the use of Taoist words and concepts.
