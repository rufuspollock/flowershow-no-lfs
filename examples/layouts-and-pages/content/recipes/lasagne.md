## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

3. In a large skillet, brown the ground beef over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic, and cook until the onions are translucent and the beef is fully cooked.
4. Add the marinara sauce, crushed tomatoes, dried basil, salt and pepper to the skillet. Stir well and let simmer for 10 minutes.
5. In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, and grated parmesan cheese. Stir well.
6. In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Then add a layer of lasagne noodles on top. Add a layer of the cheese mixture on top of the lasagne noodles. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.
7. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
8. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.
9. Let the lasagne cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.
